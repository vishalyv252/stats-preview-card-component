# stats-preview-card-component :
In this project, I created a "Stats Preview Card Component" using "React JS" and "Tailwind". In Tailwind, I used flex as the layout for styling the card component and I applied overflow for scrolling in mobile view. Whereas React allows you to write the HTML code within a javascript file using "JSX". If you want to see the  website , click the website below the description of this repository.
